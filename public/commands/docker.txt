Image: 
- An image is an immutable, shareable file that is stored in a Docker-trusted registry. A Docker image is built up from a series of read-only layers. Each layer represents an instruction that is being given in the image’s Dockerfile. An image holds all the required binaries to run.

Container: 
- An instance of an image is called a container. A container is just an executable image binary that is to be run by the host OS. A running image is a container.

Dockerfile: 
- A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all of the commands / build instructions, a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. This will be saved as a Dockerfile. (Note the lowercase 'f'.)

Docker-Compose: 
- Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services (containers). Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. The Compose file would be saved as docker-compose.yml.
